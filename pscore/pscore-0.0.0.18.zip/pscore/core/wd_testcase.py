This module includes any required TestCase subclasses.  These are then subclassed by the consuming test classes
to inherit the setup and teardown hooks responsible for initiating driver instanstiation, finalization and any resulting
actions.

    AF Note:
    I think we need a way for a consumer to specify their own log package.
    We also need (somehow) to have a common implied contract so we can leave it up to duck typing.
    Should our TestLog class be a subclass of logging.Logger?
